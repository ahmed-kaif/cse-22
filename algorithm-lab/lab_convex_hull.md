# Compare between quick hull & graham scan

- Points must be same for a particular value of n

# Matrix multiplication

- Iterative method
- Recursive Matmul
- Strassen's Algorithm for Matmul

For various matrix size, compare contrast time taken

Example:
A = 7x3
B = 3x4 
max(7,3,4) = 7 
nearest largest power of 2 = 8
so convert all the matrices to 8x8 matrix

## Zero Padding
make other extra elements zero to make the size of the matrix a power of two
